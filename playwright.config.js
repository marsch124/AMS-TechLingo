// every control is found by its data-testid (never by its words), and the suite
// grows ONE test at a time, each one seen to FAIL before it is trusted.
// Local: `npm run test:ui`. The app is plain static files, so the web server is
// Python's built-in one — present on every machine and every GitHub runner.
